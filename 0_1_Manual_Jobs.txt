Update OS with built in updater

Right Click Desktop - Customize - Icon Spacing on Desktop so top left icon is where you want it...

Menu - Themes - Settings - Turn off "Jump to position when clicking in a trough (I like to go a page at a time)

Menu - Login - Settings - Slide Numlock On, Change Mouse to DMZ-White, Check Icon & Theme and wallpaper etc on main page

Right Click the Menu Button, Choose Configure - Set the icon size to 42 (Will make it slightly bigger)

Pin Items you want to panel(s) - You can replace the OS_Overlay\etc\skel\.config\cinnamon\spices\grouped-window-list@cinnamon.org\2.json to change the panel items by copying the new panel from Main User.

Set default associations (I will try to automate this job, but required for now)

? Do a folder Share so files are added and user is configured <- Leave this to each user post install.
