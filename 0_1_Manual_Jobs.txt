Update OS with built in updater

Right Click Desktop - Customize - Icon Spacing on Desktop so top left icon is where you want it...

Menu - Themes - Settings - Turn off "Jump to position when clicking in a trough (I like to go a page at a time)

Menu - Login - Settings - Slide Numlock On, Change Mouse to DMZ-White, Check Icon & Theme etc on main page

Right Click the Menu Button, Choose Configure - Set the icon size to 42 (Will make it slightly bigger)

Pin Items you want to panel(s) - You can replace the OS_Overlay\etc\skel\.config\cinnamon\spices\grouped-window-list@cinnamon.org\2.json to change the panel items by copying the new panel from Main User.

? Do a folder Share so files are added and user is configured <- Leave this to each user post install.

Below isn't required anymore, added --file LastOSeggs.yaml to root of this folder works with 10.0.0.10-1+

* NOTE Script 09 will require you to configure the settings: (*** DON'T USE SPACE, needs to be live or something as space doesn't work in the LiveOS to elevate to sudo), use a different password for root so you can run GParted from the menu, needs root password, not live user.

#LastOS <- Prefix name
#Linux <- basename
#LiveCD user: live
#password: live
#root password: root
#compression (fast for testing, max for release)

## Above saved to /etc/penguins-eggs.d/eggs.yaml - But has your Linux Kernel version generated in it so can't overlay.
