Easy trick for figuring out where some user setting is stored.
1. Open a terminal and run command touch a to create a file "a", or use whatever name
2. Change a setting in the program you want to figure this out for
3. Run command find ~ -type f -newer a which looks for any file in your home directory that was modified more recently than "a" that we created in step 1

If you do that for xed it will likely give you several hits but the important one is the file .config/dconf/user. That is the configuration storage database for most programs. You can install dconf-editor to get a program with which you can browse this database. The dconf command line tool can be used from bash to load/dump blocks of settings in one go or you can use the higher level gsettings command line tool to set/reset individual settings. The command line tools are both available by default and you don't need to install dconf-editor for that.

One approach to your question is the following:
1. Set up Xed exactly as you want
2. Use the command dconf dump /org/x/editor/ > editor to dump the Xed settings to the file "editor"
3. Then on any other user account account where you want to use these same settings, copy the "editor" file and use the command dconf load /org/x/editor/ < editor to load Xed settings from that file
The contents of "editor" file is plain text so you can also read it.
