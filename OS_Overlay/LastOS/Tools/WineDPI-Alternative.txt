I'll post my solution for other people that come by. You can accomplish this by running X inside X, and then connecting to it over VNC.

First I start an X that is about 1/2 the size of a full screen window on my machine:

Xephyr -once -screen 1594x876 :1

Then I share it over VNC, but scale it to 2x:

x11vnc -localhost -display :1 -scale 2:nb -repeat

Then I start the program on that display:

DISPLAY=:1 wine  ...

and finally I connect to it with VNC:

vncviewer localhost

For really old games (like You Don't Know Jack) you can adjust the values to get a 3x zoom.
