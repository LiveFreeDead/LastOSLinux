In Ventoy pick your USB disk you want to format and make bootable, make sure you understand it will delete all data on the DISK not just a partition.

Once the USB is formated and ready, copy your downloaded LastOSLinux_amd64_202x-xx-xx-xxxx.iso file (* Not it's contents) to the USB drive called ventoy that you just prepared above (May need to safely remove and re-insert the USB disk for write access with some devices)

Copy the USB_Overlay folder "contents" that should open to /LastOS/Tools/USB_Overlay (* Not the folder, just the contents inside it) to the USB drive called ventoy

You are then able to add your applications and games to your USB drive in the LLTek/ sub folders, put apps in LLTek/LLAppsInstalls and games in LLTek/LLGamesInstalls etc.
